                People like to refer to us as the TIPS team, but we do much more than TIPS and Blackboard. We enjoy helping everyone in our U of A family to succeed: students, faculty, and staff. It is our goal to create effective solutions to your technology problems.
                We want to make your job easier for you to do.  The areas we work in are teaching technology support, technology consultation for research, teaching, and administration, workshops, and help bring new technologies to the U of A.
